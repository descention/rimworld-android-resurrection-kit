To use, right click the item on the ground and pick the use option. Then select the dead android you want to rebuild.

If you try using a B-Tier on a T2 or higher, you'll get a message like "can't be repaired, thanks for trying". Same applies for an A-Tier on a T3 or higher.

All items can be produced at Android Parts Workbench, and B-Tier kits can additionally be produced at normal machining table if you feel so inclined.
